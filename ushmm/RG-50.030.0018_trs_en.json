My mother was left with five children and we didn't have to eat much, and I remember a German man came to our house and he said in German \"Vvielleicht meine Frau und Kinder, sie leiden auch,\" like their children suffered too. He told my mother you're so young and you're beautiful. Leave here, take your children and go, but my mother had a mother that she had red eyes and she was old and she wouldn't leave her mother. She had a sister one sister she was the most beautiful girl in the whole city but blonde hair. She was only 18 years old and one sister had two children and my mother wouldn't leave her sister. So, they didn't leave so she sent away her sister, the 18 year old with white blonde hair but me and my brother \u2014 my brother is in Israel now, he's younger, four years, than me and a sister two years younger \u2014 she sent us away to the Russian side, so the border we couldn't go through so at night we went through because it was already closed, the border. We had a very hard time getting through there. We came to Lomza. It was in Poland, a place where my mother left. She was wearing a green scarf and she was crying. I said, \u201cMommy don't cry. We're going to see each other. It's not going to take long.\u201d Who knew for the rest of my life I'd never see her again? We left and my aunt brought us there. She brought us to Lomza. My father wasn't there. My father was in the army and he came back home so I was praying that my mother's going to come. Then my father came alone and my aunt gave us away in an orphanage and she left to bring my mother, to bring the whole family here and she gave us to an orphanage, and I was crying every single day. Every single day, \u201cWhere's my mommy? I don't have my mommy. I want my mommy.\u201d I was young."

I was crying the most because when I was young I used to go up to mother like this holding her by her dress. I was very attached to my mother. So, what happened, my ; \u201cMaybe my wife and children are suffering, too\u201d (German) father came by himself, for my aunt was there and she never came back."

He helped the brother put her in a ghetto and they brought her food and they were helping her. It's the only person that we thought was the biggest antisemite \u2014 he was helping my mother. We went to Lakhva to a small town and I went to the Russian school there. I was very good in school, and my father was so proud of me. \u201cThe war is going to finish and we're going to see your mother and everybody is going to come together.\u201d My father wrote to Stalin a letter that he should let my mother come and if the war wouldn't have started my mother would have come with the children. All the family would come. But the war started and the Germans came, and we again are in trouble, run away from the Germans. So, when the Germans came it started being a lot of trouble."

I wanted to run off from the ghetto. So we had people that were police in the ghetto \u2014 Jewish people, young guys. So I started running out of the ghetto to steal bread \u2014 because I was a tomboy \u2014 to bring some bread, not steal, bring some bread to the house. We should have something to eat. I just didn't eat by myself and I brought bread when I ran out of the ghetto. I gave to lots of people.

Then he was gone, so I run away * Stanislaw Zalewski and I came to a neighbor of ours under the bed I was laying and when he came he said, \u201cWhere is the maid? Ich will sie totschlagen.\u201c\" He would have killed me. Because for them to say a lie is the worst thing that you could do. That's before the ghetto started. I was so beaten I couldn't see.

We had like \u2014 we made, it wasn't beds, it was like they made they put like wood on the top and on the bottom something like that to sleep and there were a few families living together in the ghetto, and then we started hearing that they are going to kill the Jews. When they're going to kill the Jews then somebody came and they said to my father that, \u201cT think it's going to happen in the next few days.\u201d So, when they started talking about burning everything, like all the things we have, we should burn. Nobody should have it. Not the Belorus, not the Germans, should get nothing that we have. We started putting gasoline when we knew that the next day we're going to get killed. So we saw everybody what they were standing. I went out, I remember, very early in the morning and I saw the Germans pulling up with guns, with all kinds of things, they were holding like this, you know, everything, and they were pointing at the ghetto. My father was running out of the house and I didn't know what he said. \u201cYou wait here. Don't go anyplace. We have to be together now.\u201d And they started burning. It wasn't just my father, it was lots of people. I really can't remember their names, but Lopatyn\u201d was one of these. His name should be forgotten really. I remember even how he looked, and then there was other people too. They burned everything. They started burning and there was smoke, and I saw there was a bridge not far from us and I saw friends of mine sitting with the feet holding like this, and they were taking them to a cemetery to shoot them. > Dov Lopatyn (1900-1944), head of Lakhva Judenrat and former Zionist leader. And my father said like that \u201clet's run.\u201d Before we were running, I was near water. The water was death, they called the water death like \u201csmierc\u201d in Polish. And I saw the Germans. They were fighting with the Jews with knives and with ax and there as one man a Rev-Zionist , the same party as Begin, and he was holding an ax on a German over the head in the water, and the German killed him right away and they went to a doctor. And I saw this, and I was standing with my father and my brother and my sister with their hands like this. My father said, \u201cDon't go away. We have to be with each other. Maybe we'll run away.\u201d So, it was burning and here I saw something that I took so much revenge, I said to myself, \u201cI'm going to die anyway in a few minutes. It's going to now.\u201d You didn't think you're going to survive, you're going to live. Who's going to live? Nobody thought they were going to live, but at least before I die I'm going to have revenge, and I saw that Rochczyn\u2019 \u2014 a man, he was belonging to the party like Begin and he gave with the ax over the head. So, a man, a doctor was there. He was from Warsaw himself, he came like we came, in the wartime, running away from the Germans. So, they told him like that, \u201cWe're going to save all your family if you're going to save that German.\u201d He says, \u201cYou could kill me too because I don't give a damn anymore because I'm not going save him \u2014 he could die.\u201d But Rochczyn right away they shot him. He got killed in the water, but they were fighting with knives, with anything they had, they said, \u201cWe're not going to let ourselves just take to the death just like that.\u201d They took only the weak."

The old ghetto was burned. There was nothing left of it. Nothing in one house, nothing, because I was there after the war. I came after the war there and there was nothing left at all. But you know, even after the war when we came I was proud to come there. I lived there over a year. They took away my father to the army. I met my father back when they took him away to the Russian army. I lived there for a year for sure and I gave him my brother to the orphanage because I didn't have any money and I went to the orphanage after the war. I took my brother and I went on the train and they told me \u201cdo you have a ticket?\u201d I didn't have a piece a bread even to eat and I was very young. I said, \u201cWhat kind of ticket. I went through a war, and I was sitting in the woods for so many years, do you think I have money to buy a ticket? You can kill me if you want, but I'm not going to give you nothing. I'm going to take my brother and go and if you want to take me off of that train, you'll have to kill me first.\u201d So, they let me through. I took my brother to Pinsk after the war in an orphanage. I only wanted that they dress him up and I should be able to see him again from that orphanages, from the Russians and I'll bring him back home because he didn't have nothing to wear.

When he told, \u201ctoday is Yom Kippur,\u201d he passed by like he didn't have nothing to wear and I saw him and I didn't even believe he's alive. And he passed by and he said to me, \u201ctoday is Yom Kippur.\u201d I didn't eat. I didn't want to eat anything even though we didn't have much to eat, we were hungry most of the time. We were in the water and that Ukrainian woman said to me that the Germans were on the top. They were shooting. They surrounded us, the Germans, and we were lying in the water very deep like in the time that was in the woods already, and we're lying. She said to me, \u201cMake with your feet like this because otherwise the feet will fall off. They came off,\u201d she said, \u201cmake with your feet, just work with them, just like exercise with them, do something, because otherwise you're going to lose your feet.\u201d Up there they were shooting us with airplanes and around they were shouting, the Germans were running. In the middle of that the partisans came and they started fighting with the Germans. You know they were going like, how could I say it in English \u2014 even if I\u2019m so many years, since I was 18 years old in Canada \u2014 na shtyki\u2019, they were going with big knives like this one on one. They didn't care. They said, \u201cwe're going to get killed, we're going to get killed,\u201d and we were lying in the water and all of sudden from nowhere they came and they saved probably our lives at that time."

It's a big city and they took away my father to the army, and they took my brother and I went to Lakhva to the place \u2014 because I knew lots of Jews are there. When I came, I met lots of my friends, lots of people that I was in the woods together who were living in the same house. You see the house the Germans took away and then the Russian people moved in. So, they were Jewish houses, so we moved into the houses. They all lived there. Then I stared \u2014 when I was living there I thought to myself, \u201c\u201cWhat am I going to do with my brother? He hasn't got a pair of shoes. He's got bare feet, with nothing on his feet. What am I going to do with him? How ts he going to go to school?\u201d At that time four years younger than me. I was about 14 years old, so he was about ten, so \u201cwhat am I going to do with him?\u201d I have to dress him up at least so I said to my brother, \u201cyou know what\u201d \u2014 in Pinsk there was a big city, there is an orphanage there and somebody gave me the address. I said, \u201cyou know we'll go together. We'll go on the train.\u201d He said to me, \u201cHow are you going to go on the train?\u201d I said \u201cYou don't worry how I'm going to go. I'm going to go, don't worry.\u201d So I told you when I went on the train, \u201cyou could kill me because I don't have a ticket.\u201d So I went and got him into the orphanage. Then my father wrote me that he's coming back from the army. Then, you know what I did? I went and I stealed him from the orphanage. I told him I'm going for a walk with him. When I took him out and we went back on the train the same thing \u2014 I didn't have any money so I went without money like that. So, I was standing at that time, when they came to control the tickets, you know, the middle [indecipherable] there is a platform. I went to the platform with him and I stood there. When the ticket control passed by I went back to the train and that's the way I came back from Lakhva from Pinsk. It didn't take long. It took maybe an hour. But there an hour,,,. And I brought him back, and we went to my father to Lodz, to Poland. Then I met my husband there."

I'm going to think that I'm going to marry him? I said, \u201cYou're crazy. Anja (ph), why are you talking like that?\u201d That was Erwin's wife, and I knew Erwin since 1951, very well. I said, \u201cYou're crazy, don't talk like that.\u201d But every single day that his wife died, I started asking him to go for a walk because he was very depressed and he was talking about his wife all the time and we were going and walking a lot, and talking. Then, I fell in love with him after, and the same thing happened to him I think. So, I never believed that in that age I'm going to fall in love with somebody, because I think I love him more than my life because after that he was so sick a few times he was in the hospital. Quite a few times, and I stood by him and I always gave him faith. When he was in the hospital with a by-pass and this is the second one, because 15 years ago he had one bypass and this was the second one. He thought he was not going to live because the doctor told him that that by-pass is not going to be able to make a by-pass. I told him, \u201cDon't believe the doctor what he says. I heard many doctors. They talk to the patient and they die before the patient dies, so don't listen. You'll see that you're going to be alive and you're going to be able to have the operation.\u201d A few days later he came and he says, \u201cYou know, what we're going to try to operate.\u201d He was so happy, just like he was going to go to dance, and I said to him like that, \u201cBefore you go to the operation, have faith, believe that you're going to live and after you're going to see we're going to buy the most beautiful things for the house. You're going to sell all the old junks you have and we're going to buy the nicest things. You're going to see you're going to have the most beautiful life. Just believe it.\u201d He was six weeks in the intensive care and I was sitting every single day and talking like that. \u201cJust believe it, you'll see, you're going to have a good life.\u201d Just like I thought in the time of the war. I didn't think I was going to live but I still didn't want to believe it because I think I'm a survivor."
