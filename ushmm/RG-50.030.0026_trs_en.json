So I call him. I still remember how I climbed the -- climbed the stairs. I got such a weakness 1n my -- being so young, in my knees, because the doctor was some very high steps. You had to climb the steps and I just couldn\u2019t get on the steps. So on four I climbed the step screaming, my mother -- I didn\u2019t say my mother fainted, I said, \u201cMy mother\u2019s dying, my mother\u2019s dying.\u201d It was too late.

So he took a sleeping train, I should be -- and I vomit a lot when I was traveling, so he was afraid to let me travel just like that. So he took me in the sleeping train, and we came home. Before we had to -- we didn\u2019t have a station. Like here, you come, you take a cab, you go to -- from the airport, straight. We had to travel from my town. We had a man that used to pick us up by wagon and horse. So he was waiting [indecipherable] about 30 kilometers - 50 kilometers from -- from -- from my town. And he used to bring us home. He knew -- he worked for us f -- for my father for so many years.

He knew that I cannot have a su-substitute for my mother, he knew my attitude. So he was afraid that I won\u2019t come home for the summer. But so close to home, where will I go, I cannot go back already. So he decided that he\u2019ll tell me. My father, returning from his convalescent home, wherever he was, at the train he met a woman from Wilna which was a divorcee with a child -- with a son three years older than I. And my father was a ga -- a very good looking man, very handsome and with a lot of money, so what\u2019s bad about? She was a very smart cookie.

And we stayed there a day or two and we went home. And then slowly, slowly, she start to come visiting and I knew that it\u2019s something more than a plain visit. You know, I wasn\u2019t really baby baby. And I saw my father\u2019s attitude, he was in ba -- he was in bad shape, he didn\u2019t -- he wanted to do so much for his kids. And in the same token, I guess he fell in love. Which I could swear, and anybody else that knew him, that this could never happen after -- because s-such a life that he had with my mother, you don\u2019t see, you don\u2019t hear. And that was -- and that was it. Then slowly, slowly, now this was \u201939 already, close to the 40\u2019s, the Russian come in. My father was already the -- they wanted him, they were watching him, he couldn\u2019t do this, he couldn\u2019t do this.

Sure I lost quite a few friends, this -- this was -- and then in this ghetto my husband came one time. Said to my father, \u201cYou see, I told you what will happen. I warned you, I begged you. You didn\u2019t have to go through that. The woods are full of trees and the trees are covering us. Here, no matter how you walk out, they\u2019Il see you.\u201d And I was upset about it because the reason that I worked in gardens of one of the Polacks -- lot of people, you know, were used -- they -- they used to plant and we had to clean it and watch it and water it and there was big fields of -- of -- of gardens. In the fee -- and it was so hot in the summer, and the German was standing over you and you couldn\u2019t -- you know, you really couldn\u2019t not work, or play that you are sick, or you don\u2019t feel good. What -- what more you complain, the s -- more you got over your head. Somehow my stepmother was very good fren -- friends with the owner of this -- of this gardens that he was in charge of them. I don\u2019t know if it was his or if he was only in charge with the -- th-the Germans made him 1n charge of it. But he lived there, and as soon you know, they produced to make [indecipherable] tomorrow was a -- a section. To- Tomorrow it will be something happen. I pass by I heard somebody say tomorrow something will happen this guy, this guy. And that\u2019s how in the ghetto started to where the talking and what to -- what we will do, where will we hide, and what -- how and what. At night still were young, we used to -- too long we couldn\u2019t go, and too far we couldn\u2019t go, but next door we used to [indecipherable] and come to one backyard all together and sing fa -- Hebrew songs and -- and tell stories and what will happen, how come that we\u2019ll have a terrible youth. And you know, and go home, next day you had to go to work. So I remember one fact, that right after this action in ma -- in May eight, and they told us that the next day we have to go to work and we should all get together in this and this point. I had a watch. I wanted to check the time I shouldn\u2019t be too late because I was afraid. You had so much fear in yourself, you weren\u2019t -- when he didn\u2019t mean to do nothing to you but to look. Not so much I -- even from the Germans, like from the Polacks that the pol -- the police that helped them out. And I -- I ask somebody what time 1s this, and a Polish guy came over to me and he said the time, and I said thank you, and we went into the house. Didn\u2019t take an hour, he comes in with a German. He says, \u201cWhere is the girl that asked me what time it is?\u201d My father ra -- pushed me already away out to the room, complete to another room where other people were. And he showed him, he said this one, this one. He said no. I want to see the girl that asked me the time. So my father got very nervous and he started already, he said, \u201cKill me. What do you want to do to her? Kill her? Kill me, \u2019'm old man.\u201d Four- he was maybe 46 years there. Kill me. Said, \u201cNo, PII tell you what, I won\u2019t do nothing to you. Pll -- 11 murder you, but after you give me your -- your dau -- what connection do you have?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to tell him that I\u2019m his daughter. Anyway, I saw it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very crucial, I came out. I came out and he said -- \u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d I said, \u201cI just ask you what time because I wanted to be on time tomorrow morning.\u201d It was just a stupid game that he wanted to scare the whole house and he want to make a -- a game of it. Turned around, took away my watch and went out. What di -- what did I do? But just stupid game. You know, anything to show the authorities that they -- they-they are the big shots. And this wasn\u2019t the lesson for my father either, because that time I started to bother him [indecipherable] look, we went through, we could have waited. Tuvya asked us, he begged us, who else ha -- who else has in the whole ghetto such a privilege to go out of the ghetto one of the first ones because people would love it, but they didn\u2019t know how and what. What Daddy said, Daddy said. And after the action this was [indecipherable] I\u2019ll never forget. I came for my girlfriend, in fact, she was killed wi -- in the woods, from the white Polacks. Her sister and brother-in-law still in Israel, and the whole family was saved by my husband. And we were sitting in their backyard, singing, you know, songs from- from -- from I don\u2019t know, maybe 60 - 70 years ago they used to sing that in -- in the Jewish tradition. And I came home, and I said -- and I [indecipherable] crawl to my bed. It was very crowded to pass b-by to find your bed, you know, but was cold and chilly. So I took my girlfriend\u2019s jacket, I put the -- threw it on top of me. A blazer. Came home and I lay down in bed, took off the jacket, took off my clothes, lay down [indecipherable] ready to work. [indecipherable] I wasn\u2019t working all right. [indecipherable] had, you know, we had -- didn\u2019t have any peace in the house, she always why didn\u2019t you do that. Why didn\u2019t you cook, why didn\u2019t you bring, why didn\u2019t you that? Til one day, I\u2019m going -- I\u2019Il bad -- back to this story with ma -- with the jacket, because that was the night that we left the ghetto. But what I want to tell you from my stepmother and I said, in the beginning I didn\u2019t want to confess to. [indecipherable] I will tell it. Let it be on record, let people know that when you are making a hole for somebody, you are the first one to fall. She said to me -- I come to work in the fields and the one that I told you was in charge of me, says to me, \u201cToday you\u2019ll work later.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can I work later, how can I get to the ghetto later? After six o\u2019clock, if I\u2019ll be met by -- by the Germans and by the police, I\u2019ll be killed.\u201d We have no excuse, they kill you on the spot. That was a [indecipherable] and now order [indecipherable]. Said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you but I need you for work.\u201d What can I do? Helpless. My stepmother sometimes didn\u2019t come home when she heard rumors that something\u2019s going to happen the ha -- ghetto, she used to hide herself there on the roof. He used to hide her. Her and another few. Came six o\u2019clock he says to me, \u201cGo home.\u201d I said, \u201cYou told me to stay. I have nothing to lose already, cause after six I won\u2019t go nowhere.\u201d He said, \u201cGo, go with the group, return to the ghetto in time.\u201d Passed a few weeks, and he starts telling me a story, that my stepmother paid with the money from five ruble gold, of my father\u2019s money to keep me later in order he should send me home and I should be killed by the Germans. So what for you needed the Germans that your own people could kill you. And I -- I kept it a secret for a long, long time. And he said to me, \u201cYou know, even not being Jewish, I had no conscious, because you were so innocent, I couldn\u2019t do it. I took the money from her, but was for money they were [indecipherable]. But I told her P\u2019ll do some other time, not today.\u201d And I kept it a secret for a long time, I didn\u2019t tell no one. First well I thought nobody will believe me.

I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going to the wolves, I\u2019m going to the bears, I\u2019m going to the -- to the woods without nothing. It\u2019s very har -- 1t was very hard to turn into a animal, being a human being. In that time we were animals, but we were -- we had freedom. We could move. Not in daytime, but at night time. And that\u2019s how the leadership of my husband went. My husband was [indecipherable] then we were constantly together. He was with his girlfriend and I was with my family, but this was counted as we lived in one bunker, you know, we made one -- one place of -- of living together. And he saw that -- how much suffering I\u2019m [indecipherable] how alone I am in this world. And he saw that my father wants to help me and he can, but he was -- he was threatened that she\u2019l leave him [indecipherable] do that. So he - and so he tried, he tried to supply me boots, he tried to supply me warm clothes. He tried to always when he went out to bring something more for me. He told me always not to take so much to heart, things will change, everything will pass."

            "question": "All right, tell us again who made up the group, the first group, once you got out of the ghetto.",
            "answer": "When I came to the woods, there was no group, there was a family, members of the family, there was -- all related to each other. And they were in -- hesitating if to accept new people. Because like I had mentioned before, there was a question of supporting them, there was a question of feeding them, and this wasn\u2019t the easy thing, because they had nothing with -- a-and they were empty handed. The whole luck of it was that they were raised -- the Bielskys were raised in villages, in hills, in woods, wi -- and trees were their friends. So they weren\u2019t afraid to knock in a peasant\u2019s window. They weren\u2019t afraid if -- to knock in -- and they had s -- their stories with the peasant. For instance my husband -- where they -- wher -- f-first of all where they -- where they came during the day, they didn\u2019t sleep the night. Or they slept, they didn\u2019t -- they weren\u2019t during the day. They couldn\u2019t stay because they were afraid for their own shadow, and we didn\u2019t have any trust. It\u2019s not [indecipherable] determines. That was, at that time we were- we organized, it was White Russia. So you had the wh -- white Polacks, the white Russian. Then you had the Polacks that they wanted to be very friendly with the Germans and they helped them a lot. So to give out a Jew, it was just a cinch. It was a -- a -- a big deal. And they were know in there, in their facilities where they lived. But they had a -- their father had the -- a mill. I personally did not know my in-laws. When I got to know them, they weren\u2019t alive already. Ah, when I could get to know them, they weren\u2019t alive already. They were taken away to [indecipherable] ghetto and were killed. So I knew only the one that they were in the ghettos -- they -- they were in the woods with us, I\u2019m sorry. And for instance, my husband had a friend -- first of all, my husband was a military man. He was in the Polish army for two years and he was a very good soldier and he had right away a [indecipherable] of certain things that he did better than others. He was very good in languages. First of all, he was g -- he grew up between Gentiles. They had the business, they had mills. They had t-to -- to grind th-their grains, they had to -- to do a lot of things that they -- you know, there was very little Jewish temples, if they had to go to temple for a holiday, they had to walk about two, three kilometers. They didn\u2019t have this in their village. They were the only Jewish family in their village. But they had good things too done, and certain people that they want to remember, and th-the -- they pay -- they pay them a good price later on. Meaning what? Let\u2019s say there was a neighbor, my husband\u2019s friend that came to the mill for a certain thing. I don\u2019t remember what he came for but was -- I really -- I wasn\u2019t born there, I don\u2019t know the -- the -- all the obstacles there, but that\u2019s what I heard and read fa -- about my husband. So he came there, and there was a he -- they were not poor people either, the -- the neighbors, the -- the man that I\u2019m telling you the story about. And there was a mill by [indecipherable] not far from each other, and there was a big river. This guy was 12 or 13 years old and he went to the river, he jumped, and he drowned. My husband was right near the river and he saw that. He jumped in his clothes and he saved him. His parents never could forget that. In the time of the war, when he find out that he is somewhere in the neighborhood, he paid him a visit. But he didn\u2019t know even which house is his. This was so many years ago. Accidentally he knocked in the house of his parents, and he ask him about Andre. And his father says -- he recognized him immediately, he said, \u201cYou are -- God brought you here, you are my son\u2019s savior. You saved his life. He is not living with me, but right here and here he is living, go knock in his door, he\u2019|l be very happy to see you.\u201d And sure enough he did it, and as he knocked in the door, he said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s a very familiar voice, but I don\u2019t know the name, I don\u2019t remember you.\u201d He says, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember how you drowned and I saved you?\u201d \u201cOh my God,\u201d he said, \u201cBielsky, what are you doing? I thought you are long time not between the living.\u201d Took him in, he stationed him, he gave him to eat. There was days that th-they were hungry. They couldn\u2019t find the -- a house to go in or they couldn\u2019t, or there was Germans, or there were Poles, or they -- the owner didn\u2019t let them in because he was afraid for him his ho -- his lo -- own life. But a lot of risked their own life. And he was very happy with him, and he said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m married, I have a family. Do me a favor, let me tell my wife that you are one from the Polacks that escaped from the army and you are trying to hide, and you are not Jewish.\u201d At the moment my husband said to him, \u201cOkay, tell her what you want.\u201d But as the day passed and he rested up, and he came to his senses, he said, \u201c\u201cWhy should you lie to your wife? Did I lie to my conscious by saving you? I want to tell her the truth.\u201d And sure enough, she reacted beautifully, according to the story from my husband. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, you are a human being, and Ill do anything and everything.\u201d But for the neighbors she tried to play the same game. And at the same night, her sister-in-law came to visit them, she asks them -- they named him right away a different name, my husband, and she said, \u201cWho is this guest in your house?\u201d And she said her name was Mary, and she says, \u201cMary,\u201d to her sister-in-law, \u201coh, we have a Polish guy that escaped from the army and he\u2019s hiding.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cyou know what? I want them all in my house next week. Ill make a little party and we\u2019ll have a good time. Bring your guest along with you.\u201d Course for some reason, I don\u2019t know if they knew or they didn\u2019t know, but they didn\u2019t go. Husband and wife didn\u2019t go, and my husband went to her, and he knocks in the door and walks in, and the table\u2019s all set, and five heavy-set Germans are sitting and drinking and eating. She didn\u2019t lose her head -- they ask right away who are you. She didn\u2019t lose her head and she says to them, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a friend. That\u2019s my sister-in-law\u2019s friend that he\u2019s working for us, blah, blah, blah, whole story. They shook hands with him, he was shivering. He said that he da -- he was telling me always that he does not know how the table didn\u2019t turn over from his knees shaking. And he said -- and he drank, and he was afra -- afraid to drink too much, maybe he\u2019ll say something, you know, you are not responsible for after awhile. So he said, \u201cYou know what, I cannot leave -- I have to go to my work, I have to go to my job. I cannot stay too long.\u201d And they ask -- so he ask them, he wanted to know what\u2019s going on in the world. He said, \u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s our situation by the way? How do we fight?\u201d \u201cOh, we are so close to Moscow.\u201d We are so close to here, we are so close to there. It won\u2019t take no time and we\u2019ll be the winners of the world. Shook hands with them nicely, said goodnight and disappeared. He ran so fast -- it was a cold night -- he ran so fast that he thought in his mind it was a fantasy or a thought, I don\u2019t know how to describe that, that somebody\u2019s running. He\u2019s hurt, he didn\u2019t realize that ha -- he\u2019s hurt, he\u2019s speeding so fast that he thought that somebody\u2019s behind him running after him until he fell into the snow, to the deep snow. And in the deep snow, saw that it\u2019s very cold, he\u2019ll freeze to death, he\u2019ll remain here. He got up, he shlepped through to some other house where they let him in and -- and at that time it was empty -- still empty handed. But this guy, I think -- I think, I\u2019m not sure, gave him the first gun, or the first rifle, or the si -- fi -- or showed him a place where he could get. But this was the first guy that filled his hands up that he should -- shouldn\u2019t be empty handed."

I don\u2019t know how -- how to -- to calculate that. But he had the whole information from the [indecipherable] ghetto and he was the one to send constantly with messages to the ghetto and get to the people and give them the letters.

And he wrote him, for your sake, \u201cFor my sake, for the sake for the Jewish nation, please organize and get out of the ghetto. We had -- the roots are wide, the forests are deep. We\u2019ll survive, if not all of us, some of us. In ghetto you have no chance.\u201d With this message, after awhile, came seven young boys. And one of them I want to tell you should have died [indecipherable] mentioned it. And they sat down, seven boys and I think -- and I\u2019m very sure that I don\u2019t remember exactly if two wives came with them, or they came a short time after that. And they came to the woods. And then, in between them, they made a meeting and they said, \u201c\u201cTuvya, you are the oldest from all of us,\u201d -- he was at that time in the early 30\u2019s, \u201cand you had military experience, you were in the army, you know what discipline 1s. We want you to lead the group.\u201d So he answered them, \u201cIf you listen to me, and you\u2019ll obey my orders, [Il do it.

He wanted very much to go to Israel and to work for kibbutz. But his parents -- one brother was already in the States and he -- his -- the condition, the family conditions were so poor that he had no conscious to leave, a -- mommy say- and -- and his mother said to him, you want to go to Israel, fine, take your brothers and sisters and go because we won\u2019t manage -- we won\u2019t be able to manage.
